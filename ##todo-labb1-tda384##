Add functionallity to lock switches
    Maybe check whether or not one switch "pair" has an active switch and if so lock the other one in the pair?

Make trains stop correctly
     Check if train can go south at a switch
     if not: stop

Make trains able to choose the "south" track in intersections

Make trains stop at stations
     Includes making them "invert" their previous direction upon starting again
[1,2,3,4]

if counter <= 2 && has terminal
   	aquire terminal
	change switch
	pass switch
	
else if switch sem is aquired already && has terminal
        stop train
	wait until switch semaphore is free
	start train
	
else if switch sem is aquired already && !has terminal

     if switch counter > 0
	stop train
	wait until switch semaphore is free
	start train

     else
	release the semaphore
	aquire the semaphore
	change switch
	pass switch

else
	aquire next switch
